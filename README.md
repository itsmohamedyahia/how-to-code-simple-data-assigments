My Solved Assignments of [How to Code - Simple Data] course on Edx



## ðŸŽ¾ ABOUT THE COURSE

**[How to Code - Simple Data]** is the first course of the **UBCx Software Development MicroMasters** and the first course of the **Core CS** section in the **OSSU** CS curriculum targeted to self-taught developers.



## ðŸŽ¾ MY THOUGHTS ON THE COURSE

I was first intrigued by the logic behind the HtDF recipe and how well-structured it is for designing functions. Each step helps in producing the succeeding step in the design process, even if a step seems useless. 

For example, when Professor Kiczales introduced the method stub, I thought it was just an extra step that wasn't much necessary but later on, I found how this step is very important in testing how well-formed the test examples for checking the validity of a function. Overall, Professor Kiczales delivered the course exceptionally well. 

Even if you won't design functions yourself, the course teaches you how to deal with problems in a systematic way and thus reaching a solution for complex problems much faster.
